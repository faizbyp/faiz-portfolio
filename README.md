## About

This repository is for building my portfolio website. It will contain anything needed regarding my skills and hobbies.

## Content

### Codes

As a CS Student, I like writing code and try to solve problems with it. Digging into frontend web.

### Games

Hated code when it's related to games. It's just... too complicated. Currently using Construct as my engine.

### Designs

Started graphic design in middle school. Still doing it 'till now, but not that much. Figma is my primary arsenal.

### ðŸš§ TBA ðŸš§

Maybe I'll add blogs to this website. And another thing that might interest people to work with me :D
